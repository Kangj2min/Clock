# Digital Clock

This project learn how to digital clock make and watch how much difference Performance(Lut, WNS..) of circuit each other.

This project use Vivado and if you want to only simulate, you can use modelsim that is better way (modelsim takes up less GB then vivado).

These ClockIP connect Zynq board by using AXI Architecture.

when i make it, i frequently refet to code of ### matbi_watch(https://github.com/matbi86/matbi_watch).
